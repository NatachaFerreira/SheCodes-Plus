# [SheCodes-Plus](https://www.shecodes.io/plus) - Final Project

The objective was to create a simple weather web app. I used Invision Freehand to plan the project and then worked with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, Axios, fetched the weather data with OpenWeather API and hosted it with Netlify.
